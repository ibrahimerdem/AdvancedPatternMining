## ADVANCED PATTERN MINING: THE EVALUATION OF SEQUENTIAL PATTERN MINING ALGORITHMS
### Abstract
As a problem, in order to extract sequential patterns from a sequence database, there are plenty
of algorithms introduced so far. They use different techniques in terms of scanning database,
support counting, etc. It is possible to obtain different performance measurement with different
sequential pattern mining algorithms and different size of data. In this paper it is tried to measure
the efficiency of three algorithms: SPADE, PrefixSpan, and CM-SPADE. To do this, it is used
three different real data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository: 1) MSNBC, 2) Online
Retail, 3) DNA Sequence, with an open source data mining tool, SPMF, specialized in pattern
mining. It is obvious that each algorithm have its own advantages and drawbacks. Whereas
some features seem to be advantageous for a specific type of data set, some are disadvantageous.
It is obtained that the runtime efficiency of one algorithm not only depends upon the data set
characteristics, but also minimum support threshold values are also significant impact on
process times.
